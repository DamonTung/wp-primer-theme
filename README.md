### Important Things to Note

1. We don't minify and concatenate JavaScript files. Why? Because you shouldn't do this in themes you distribute. Let caching plugins handle it.
2. We use the standard `wp_enqueue_script()` system to declare JavaScript dependencies for the theme. This is a second reason why we don't do #1.
3. All front-end development pre-compiled scripts and styles are stored in a `.dev` folder which is hidden to most users.
4. Primer supports the following features from Jetpack: infinite scroll, featured content.

### Getting Started with Development

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/).
2. Install packages by running `npm install` inside theme folder using command prompt.
3. Run Grunt by entering `grunt` into command prompt.
4. Edit files like a boss.
